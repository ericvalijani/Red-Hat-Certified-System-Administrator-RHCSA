### **Understanding PAM for RHCSA Exam:**

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a key component in Linux for controlling authentication policies and securing access. For the RHCSA exam, you should be familiar with the basics of configuring PAM to implement security policies such as password complexity, account lockout, and resource limits.

#### **Key Concepts You Need to Know:**

1. **PAM Configuration Files:**
   - PAM configurations are stored in `/etc/pam.d/`, where each service (e.g., `sshd`, `login`, `su`) has its own file.
   - These files define how authentication works for the service, using modules and control flags like `required`, `requisite`, `sufficient`, and `optional` that determine the flow of authentication.

2. **Common PAM Modules:**
   - **`pam_unix.so`:** Handles basic UNIX authentication like passwords.
   - **`pam_pwquality.so`:** Enforces password complexity policies (e.g., minimum length, requiring special characters).
   - **`pam_faillock.so`:** Locks out users after multiple failed login attempts.
   - **`pam_limits.so`:** Restricts user resources, such as the number of processes or file handles a user can have.

3. **Password Policies:**
   - You can enforce password complexity by configuring `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` or adding rules to PAM configuration files for services that require password authentication.

4. **Account Lockout:** 
   - Implement account lockout using `pam_faillock.so` to protect against brute-force attacks by locking the user account after several failed login attempts.

5. **Resource Limits:** 
   - Use `pam_limits.so` to control the maximum resources users can consume, like limiting the number of processes a user can run.

### **Sample Exam Questions:**

1. **Password Complexity Enforcement:**
   - **Question:** Configure the system to require that passwords must be at least 8 characters long, include an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a digit.
   - **Steps:** 
     1. Edit `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` to set:
        ```
        minlen = 8
        ucredit = -1
        lcredit = -1
        dcredit = -1
        ```
     2. Ensure `pam_pwquality.so` is properly included in `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` and `/etc/pam.d/password-auth`.

2. **Account Lockout Configuration:**
   - **Question:** Configure the system to lock user accounts for 10 minutes after 3 failed login attempts.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Edit `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` and `/etc/pam.d/password-auth` to include:
        ```
        auth required pam_faillock.so preauth silent deny=3 unlock_time=600
        auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail deny=3 unlock_time=600
        account required pam_faillock.so
        ```

3. **Restricting User Login Times:**
   - **Question:** Prevent the user `john` from logging in between 9 PM and 6 AM.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Edit `/etc/security/time.conf` and add:
        ```
        login;*;john;Al1800-0900
        ```
     2. Ensure `pam_time.so` is included in the PAM files for the services you want to restrict.

4. **Limiting User Resources:**
   - **Question:** Limit the maximum number of processes a user can run to 100.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Add the following to `/etc/security/limits.conf`:
        ```
        * hard nproc 100
        ```
     2. Ensure `pam_limits.so` is loaded in the relevant PAM configuration files like `/etc/pam.d/login`.
