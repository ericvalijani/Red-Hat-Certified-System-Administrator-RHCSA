**SQUID** is a caching proxy for the web that supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and other protocols. It helps improve performance and manage network bandwidth by caching frequently accessed web content and controlling web traffic. In the context of the **RHCSA exam**, you'll need to understand the basics of installing, configuring, and managing Squid as a proxy server.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what you might need for the exam:

### 1. **Installing Squid**
To start using Squid, you need to install it on your system. This can be done using:

```bash
sudo yum install squid
```

### 2. **Configuring Squid**
The main configuration file is located at `/etc/squid/squid.conf`. Squid uses this file to define access control rules, port configurations, and caching behaviors.

#### **Basic Configuration** 
- Squid typically listens on port `3128` by default. You can verify or change this in the config file:
  
```bash
http_port 3128
```

- To allow access to the proxy server from a particular subnet (for example, `192.168.1.0/24`), you need to configure access control lists (ACLs):

```bash
acl localnet src 192.168.1.0/24
http_access allow localnet
```

In this example, the subnet `192.168.1.0/24` is granted access to use the Squid proxy.

### 3. **Starting and Enabling Squid**
After configuring, you can start and enable Squid to ensure it runs after a reboot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start squid
sudo systemctl enable squid
```

### 4. **Managing Squid Service**
Common systemd commands for managing Squid:

- Check the status:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status squid
  ```

- Stop or restart the service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop squid
  sudo systemctl restart squid
  ```

### 5. **Testing the Proxy**
You can test if the Squid proxy is working by setting your web browser or system to use the proxy server at `192.168.1.1:3128` (where `192.168.1.1` is your Squid server IP address).

### 6. **Caching Web Content**
Squid can cache web pages to save bandwidth. You can customize caching behavior by modifying the `cache_dir` directive in the `squid.conf` file, which specifies the storage size and directory for caching.

For example, a basic setup:
```bash
cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256
```
This configures Squid to store 100 MB of cache in `/var/spool/squid`.

### 7. **Logs and Monitoring**
Logs are stored in `/var/log/squid/access.log` by default. You can monitor Squid's activity and troubleshoot issues by checking this log.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
```

### **RHCSA Exam Example Tasks**
1. **Install and Configure Squid** to act as a proxy server for a given network (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
2. **Allow specific IP ranges** to access the proxy while denying others.
3. **Start and enable the Squid service**, ensuring it is persistent after a reboot.
4. **Monitor and troubleshoot Squid logs** to diagnose issues with proxy access.

These steps provide a basic understanding of Squid for the RHCSA exam level. Let me know if you need more examples or guidance on specific commands!











Here are some **sample RHCSA exam questions** based on the Squid section:

---

### 1. **Install and Configure Squid**
> **Task:** 
> Install the Squid proxy server on your system and configure it to allow access from the `192.168.0.0/24` network. The proxy should listen on port `3128` (default port). Ensure the service starts at boot.

#### Steps:
1. Install Squid:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install squid
   ```
   
2. Edit the Squid configuration file `/etc/squid/squid.conf`:
   ```bash
   acl localnet src 192.168.0.0/24
   http_access allow localnet
   ```
   
3. Start and enable Squid:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start squid
   sudo systemctl enable squid
   ```

---

### 2. **Restrict Proxy Access**
> **Task:**
> Configure the Squid proxy server to deny access to the IP range `192.168.1.0/24` but allow all other internal networks (`192.168.0.0/16`).

#### Steps:
1. Edit the `/etc/squid/squid.conf` file and add the ACLs to deny the specified IP range:
   ```bash
   acl blocknet src 192.168.1.0/24
   acl allnet src 192.168.0.0/16
   http_access deny blocknet
   http_access allow allnet
   ```

2. Restart Squid:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart squid
   ```

---

### 3. **Configure HTTP and HTTPS Proxy**
> **Task:** 
> Configure Squid to allow users to browse HTTP websites but block access to HTTPS websites. You need to implement ACL rules to restrict the use of the HTTPS protocol.

#### Steps:
1. Edit the `/etc/squid/squid.conf` file to create ACL rules for HTTP and HTTPS traffic:
   ```bash
   acl allowed_http proto HTTP
   acl denied_https proto HTTPS
   http_access allow allowed_http
   http_access deny denied_https
   ```

2. Restart the Squid service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart squid
   ```

---

### 4. **Enable Authentication for Proxy Users**
> **Task:**
> Configure Squid to use basic authentication. Only authenticated users should be able to use the proxy.

#### Steps:
1. Install the `httpd-tools` package (for `htpasswd` utility):
   ```bash
   sudo yum install httpd-tools
   ```

2. Create a password file and add a user:
   ```bash
   sudo htpasswd -c /etc/squid/passwd user1
   ```

3. Edit `/etc/squid/squid.conf` to enable authentication:
   ```bash
   auth_param basic program /usr/lib64/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwd
   acl authenticated proxy_auth REQUIRED
   http_access allow authenticated
   ```

4. Restart Squid:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart squid
   ```

---

### 5. **Configure Squid to Cache Web Content**
> **Task:**
> Configure Squid to cache web content and store it in `/var/spool/squid`. Set a cache size of 150 MB and ensure that Squid uses the cache.

#### Steps:
1. Edit the Squid configuration file to define the cache directory:
   ```bash
   cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 150 16 256
   ```

2. Initialize the cache directory:
   ```bash
   sudo squid -z
   ```

3. Restart Squid:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart squid
   ```

---

### 6. **Monitor Squid Logs**
> **Task:**
> Examine the Squid logs to identify if any client from `192.168.0.5` tried to access the proxy server. Provide the details of any such requests.

#### Steps:
1. View the Squid access log:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
   ```

2. Filter for the specific client:
   ```bash
   grep 192.168.0.5 /var/log/squid/access.log
   ```

These sample questions reflect tasks you might face on the **RHCSA exam** related to Squid configuration and administration. Each question tests your ability to install, configure, manage, and troubleshoot Squid in real-world scenarios.







































# Squid

### Squid is a Unix-based, specialized proxy server that acts as a caching proxy for web objects accessed through HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.

### It is commonly used for several purposes, including caching, load balancing, `filtering traffic from websites`, and for `security` purposes.

```bash
http_access deny test-acl
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________



- ##  `allow` `incoming` `http access` to/from the IP/Port defined in the `ACL` called test-acl.
