The **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)** exam tests candidates on essential Linux system administration tasks. One of the topics covered in the exam involves the **boot loader** and managing system boot processes.

### What is a Boot Loader?
A **boot loader** is software responsible for loading the Linux kernel into memory and starting the operating system when the system boots up. For Red Hat-based systems (such as RHEL), **GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootloader)** is the default boot loader. It allows users to select between multiple kernels or operating systems (if installed).

#### Key Concepts You Should Know for the RHCSA Exam
1. **GRUB2 Configuration Files**:  
   The main GRUB2 configuration file is located at `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`, but it is **auto-generated**. Do not edit this file directly. Instead, changes should be made in files like `/etc/default/grub` and `/etc/grub.d/`.

2. **Regenerating GRUB Configuration**:  
   After making changes to the GRUB configuration (like modifying the default kernel), you must regenerate the `grub.cfg` file using the command:
   ```
   grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```

3. **Setting the Default Kernel**:  
   If there are multiple kernels installed, you might need to set a specific kernel as the default one. This can be done using the `grubby` command or editing the `/etc/default/grub` file.

   Example command:
   ```
   grubby --set-default /boot/vmlinuz-<kernel-version>
   ```

4. **Rescue and Emergency Modes**:  
   Understanding how to boot into rescue mode or emergency mode is critical. Rescue mode can be used if you cannot boot the system normally. You can edit the GRUB boot line (by pressing **`e`** at the GRUB menu during boot) to add `systemd.unit=rescue.target` for rescue mode or `systemd.unit=emergency.target` for emergency mode.

5. **Password Protecting GRUB2**:  
   For security reasons, you may want to password-protect the GRUB menu to prevent unauthorized users from changing boot parameters.

   To create a password hash:
   ```
   grub2-setpassword
   ```

   This command generates the password hash that will be added to `/etc/grub.d/40_custom` or the GRUB configuration.

   ```
[root@Server2 ~]# cat /boot/grub2/user.cfg

GRUB2_PASSWORD=grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.A3731C41BD3FBD13BA543806344018B24DEDDE980032C406E4E8A1369BCC02390922D86B9F68F772B22299E7AE144CC330FC2FBE5CB8AF666392A50F1B120056.418F448F1434292D8A01199B700ADA7303F15C9B83139C8DF5B0BF86CFA4C41D52D3DE99159DDD4277C0739A3649A224EEE94D9DBA88374A42D97C84423D9FD0
   ```



6. **Modifying Kernel Boot Parameters**:  
   You should know how to temporarily change kernel boot parameters (such as adding `rd.break` or `selinux=0`) to troubleshoot or modify the system state. This is done by pressing **`e`** at the GRUB menu, editing the boot parameters, and then booting with the modified settings.

### Example RHCSA Exam Questions Related to Boot Loader

1. **Change the default kernel at boot time:**
   - **Task:** Your system has multiple kernels installed. Configure the system to boot from a specific kernel by default.
   - **Steps:**
     1. List the installed kernels:
        ```
        grubby --info=ALL
        ```
     2. Set the desired kernel as default:
        ```
        grubby --set-default /boot/vmlinuz-<kernel-version>
        ```
     3. Verify the change:
        ```
        grubby --default-kernel
        ```

2. **Boot into rescue mode:**
   - **Task:** You need to boot the system into rescue mode to troubleshoot a problem.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Reboot the system and, at the GRUB menu, press **`e`** to edit the boot entry.
     2. Append `systemd.unit=rescue.target` at the end of the `linux16` line.
     3. Press **Ctrl+X** to boot with the modified settings.

3. **Password protect the GRUB2 bootloader:**
   - **Task:** Configure the GRUB2 bootloader to require a password.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Generate the password hash:
        ```
        grub2-setpassword
        ```
     2. The generated hash is automatically added to `/boot/grub2/user.cfg`.
     3. Update the GRUB configuration:
        ```
        grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
        ```

4. **Modify kernel parameters:**
   - **Task:** Temporarily boot the system with `selinux=0` to disable SELinux enforcement during boot.
   - **Steps:**
     1. At the GRUB menu, press **`e`** to edit the boot entry.
     2. Locate the `linux16` line and append `selinux=0` to the end.
     3. Press **Ctrl+X** to boot the system.

### Important Note About RHCSA Exam Questions

      grubby --info=ALL
      ```
   2. Identify the path of the desired kernel (typically located under `/boot/`).
   3. Set the second-oldest kernel as the default:
      ```
      grubby --set-default /boot/vmlinuz-<kernel-version>
      ```
   4. Verify the change by checking the default kernel:
      ```
      grubby --default-kernel
      ```

### 2. **Boot the System into Emergency Mode**
   **Task:**  
   Your system is experiencing a critical issue, and you need to boot into **emergency mode** to troubleshoot.

   **Steps:**

   4. Press **Ctrl+X** to boot into emergency mode.

### 3. **Add a GRUB2 Boot Loader Password**
   **Task:**  
   Secure your system by adding a password to the GRUB2 bootloader so that users must authenticate to modify boot parameters.

   **Steps:**
   1. Generate a password hash:
      ```
      grub2-setpassword
      ```
   2. The password will be added to the `/boot/grub2/user.cfg` file. Ensure this file contains the hashed password.
   3. Update the GRUB configuration:
      ```
      grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
      ```
   4. Test the change by rebooting and attempting to edit the GRUB boot parameters. You should be prompted for the password.

### 4. **Temporarily Disable SELinux at Boot**
   **Task:**  
   You suspect that SELinux is causing a boot issue. Temporarily disable SELinux by adding a kernel parameter to test the system.

   **Steps:**
   1. At the GRUB menu during boot, highlight the default boot option and press **`e`** to edit.
   2. Locate the `linux16` line and append the following to the end of the line:
      ```
      selinux=0
      ```
   3. Press **Ctrl+X** to boot the system with SELinux temporarily disabled.

### 5. **Set a Custom Boot Timeout for GRUB2**
   **Task:**  
   Modify the GRUB2 configuration so that the boot menu waits 30 seconds before automatically selecting the default kernel.

   **Steps:**
   1. Edit the file `/etc/default/grub` and change the value of `GRUB_TIMEOUT`:
      ```
      GRUB_TIMEOUT=30
      ```
   2. Update the GRUB configuration:
      ```
      grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
      ```
   3. Reboot the system and verify the timeout behavior.

### 6. **Boot with a Specific Kernel Only Once**
   **Task:**  
   You want to boot from an older kernel for troubleshooting purposes, but after rebooting, the system should revert to the default kernel.

   **Steps:**
   1. List the available kernels to find the desired one:
      ```
      grubby --info=ALL
      ```
   2. Set the system to use the specific kernel on the next boot only:
      ```
      grubby --set-default /boot/vmlinuz-<kernel-version> --once
      ```
   3. Reboot and verify the system boots into the desired kernel. On the next reboot, the system should return to the default kernel.

### 7. **Rebuild the GRUB2 Configuration after Making Changes**
   **Task:**  
   After making changes to `/etc/default/grub` and files in `/etc/grub.d/`, regenerate the GRUB configuration to apply these changes.

   **Steps:**
   1. Regenerate the GRUB configuration file:
      ```
      grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
      ```
   2. Reboot the system to verify that the new configuration is in effect.

### 8. **Configure GRUB to Boot a Minimal Rescue Environment**
   **Task:**  
   Add an entry to the GRUB menu to boot into a minimal rescue environment, useful for recovery purposes.

   **Steps:**
   1. Edit `/etc/grub.d/40_custom` and add the following entry:
      ```bash
      menuentry 'Minimal Rescue' {
         insmod lvm
         insmod ext2
         set root=(hd0,1)
         linux /vmlinuz-rescue root=/dev/mapper/rhel-root ro quiet
         initrd /initramfs-rescue.img
      }
      ```
   2. Regenerate the GRUB configuration:
      ```
      grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
      ```
   3. Reboot and select the new "Minimal Rescue" option from the GRUB menu.

### 9. **Recover a Broken GRUB Installation**

   Your system fails to boot because the GRUB bootloader is corrupt. Boot into rescue mode and reinstall GRUB on the MBR (Master Boot Record).

   **Steps:**
   1. Boot the system using a **live RHEL DVD/USB** and choose the **Rescue a Red Hat system** option.
   2. Once in rescue mode, chroot into the system's root partition:
      ```
      chroot /mnt/sysimage
      ```
   3. Reinstall GRUB on the MBR (assuming the boot device is `/dev/sda`):
      ```
      grub2-install /dev/sda
      ```
   4. Rebuild the GRUB configuration:
      ```
      grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

   Change the boot process to show a graphical boot screen (splash screen) or disable it for text-only boot output.

   **Steps:**
   1. Edit `/etc/default/grub`:
      - To **enable** graphical boot:
        ```
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rhgb quiet"
        ```
      - To **disable** graphical boot (text-only boot):
        ```
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
        ```
   2. Update the GRUB configuration:
      ```
      grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
      ```
   3. Reboot the system to apply the changes.

These tasks cover key GRUB2 and boot management scenarios you may need to perform during the **RHCSA exam**. They are modeled after real-world administrative tasks to ensure you're prepared to handle common issues or configurations related to the Linux boot process. Practicing these tasks on a **test system** will help reinforce your knowledge and prepare you for the exam.








________________________________________________________________________________________________










The Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam tests your knowledge and skills in managing a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system. One of the key topics is understanding and managing the boot loader, specifically **GRUB 2 (GRand Unified Bootloader version 2)**, which is the default boot loader for RHEL.

While I can’t provide exact previous exam questions (as they are protected by non-disclosure agreements and Red Hat’s exam policy), I can guide you through the **boot loader** concepts that are relevant to the RHCSA exam and explain them in the context of how they might be tested, including the skills you'll need.

### 1. **Understanding GRUB 2 and Boot Process**
GRUB 2 is responsible for loading the Linux kernel into memory and starting the boot process. On RHCSA, you'll need to understand:
   - Where GRUB 2 configuration files are located.
   - How to modify the GRUB 2 configuration if necessary (such as to change the default kernel, boot into single-user mode, or troubleshoot boot issues).
   - How to recover from a boot failure.

**Files:**
   - `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`: The main configuration file for GRUB 2 (automatically generated, not manually edited).
   - `/etc/default/grub`: Configuration file you will edit to modify GRUB behavior.

### 2. **Grub Configuration and Kernel Management**
   - **List of tasks you might face on the exam:**
     - Configure which kernel boots by default.
     - Boot into a specific kernel or troubleshoot with an older kernel.
     - Boot into single-user mode for recovery.

   **Example task**: "Change the default kernel to the previous one."
   - In `/etc/default/grub`, adjust the `GRUB_DEFAULT` variable:
     ```bash
     GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
     grub2-set-default 1
     ```
     The `grub2-set-default 1` command sets the second kernel in the list as the default. After making changes, regenerate the GRUB config:
     ```bash
     grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
     ```

   **Key commands:**
   - `grub2-set-default`: To select a kernel by index.
   - `grub2-mkconfig`: Rebuilds GRUB configuration.

### 3. **Boot into Single-User Mode for Troubleshooting**
   - In the RHCSA exam, you might be asked to boot into **single-user mode** to reset the root password or troubleshoot a boot issue.

   **Example task**: "Boot the system into single-user mode."
   - During boot, when the GRUB menu appears, press `e` to edit the boot entry.
   - Find the line starting with `linux16` and append `rd.break` or `single` at the end.
   - Press `Ctrl+x` to boot into single-user mode or the emergency shell.

   **Resetting the root password**:
   - If you boot with `rd.break`, you’ll get a dracut shell.
     ```bash
     mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
     chroot /sysroot
     passwd root
     touch /.autorelabel
     exit
     exit
     ```

### 4. **Rescue and Emergency Targets**
   - **Rescue mode** provides a minimal environment to recover your system when something goes wrong (similar to single-user mode but with more services).
   - **Emergency mode** is even more minimal, used to troubleshoot critical boot issues.

   **Example task**: "Boot the system into rescue mode."
   - Use the same `e` method in the GRUB menu and add `systemd.unit=rescue.target` or `systemd.unit=emergency.target` to the kernel line.

   **Commands**:
   ```bash
   systemctl rescue
   systemctl emergency
   ```

### 5. **Recovering a Corrupt GRUB**
   - You might encounter a scenario in the exam where GRUB fails, and you’ll need to restore it.
   
   **Example task**: "GRUB is corrupted, and you need to reinstall GRUB to restore the bootloader."
   - Boot from a **live RHEL installation** or **rescue mode**.
   - Mount the system partitions:
     ```bash
     mount /dev/sda1 /mnt  # Assuming /dev/sda1 is your /boot
     mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
     mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
     mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
     chroot /mnt
     ```
   - Reinstall GRUB on the bootloader:
     ```bash
     grub2-install /dev/sda
     grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
     exit
     reboot
     ```

### 6. **Kernel Updates and GRUB**
   - On the RHCSA exam, after performing a kernel update, you'll need to ensure that the correct kernel is used for booting.
   - Verify the current kernel version:
     ```bash
     uname -r
     ```
   - After installing a new kernel, you may need to check the GRUB boot order:
     ```bash
     grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
     ```

### Summary of Key GRUB 2 Skills for RHCSA:
1. **Modify GRUB boot parameters** to boot into different modes (single-user, rescue).
2. **Set default kernels** by editing `/etc/default/grub` and using `grub2-set-default`.
3. **Recover from boot failures** by reinstalling or reconfiguring GRUB.
4. **Understand the boot process** and the role of GRUB, initramfs, and the kernel.
5. **Work with the GRUB configuration** (`/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`) and regenerate it after changes.

---

The RHCSA exam won’t necessarily include all of these scenarios, but understanding how to manage and troubleshoot the bootloader, especially GRUB 2, is essential. The tasks I've outlined align with the types of challenges you'll face in real-world environments, and by practicing them, you'll be well-prepared for the exam.


________________________________________________________________________________________________



## Install Grub bootloader

in order to go to the boot menu, you can press `F8` OR keep `shift`, during the booting process.

we can press `e` to edit the grub settings and press `Ctrl+X` to reboot with the new settings.

this setting is temporary, if we wanna make it permanent, we can change the `/etc/default/grub`

________________________________________________________________________________________________

OR we select "troubleshooting" instead of normal CentOS Install

________________________________________________________________________________________________


in the boot menu, select the "Rescue a CentOS Stream system"


________________________________________________________________________________________________


then select "1) Continue"


________________________________________________________________________________________________



Press ENTER to get a shell:


________________________________________________________________________________________________


```bash
chroot /mnt/sysroot
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________

`/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`

On `BIOS-based` machines, issue the following command as root:

```bash
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```

`/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg`

On `UEFI-based` machines, issue the following command as root:

```bash
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
```



________________________________________________________________________________________________


we will search for the partition that has the `/boot`:

in our case it's sda1

```bash
lsblk
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________

## `grub2-install /dev/sda`

`install` the grub on the disk that has the boot partition:

```bash
grub2-install /dev/sda
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________


exit and reboot

```bash
exit
exit
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________


## change the Grub settings

## `/etc/default/grub`


```bash
[bob@centos-host ~]$ cat /etc/default/grub

GRUB_TIMEOUT=1
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=true
GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="no_timer_check console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0 elevator=noop"
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"
GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=true
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________




change the timeout of the grub:

```bash
GRUB_TIMEOUT=1
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________


after changing this file, we should regenerate the config file:

`BIOS-based`:

```bash
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```

`UEFI-based`:

```bash
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
```


________________________________________________________________________________________________

## `grubby --info ALL`

see current Grub settings:

```bash
[bob@centos-host ~]$ sudo dnf install grubby
```

```bash
[bob@centos-host ~]$ sudo grubby --info ALL
index=0
kernel="/boot/vmlinuz-4.18.0-240.1.1.el8_3.x86_64"

```

________________________________________________________________________________________________


### change the default kernel:


```bash
[bob@centos-host ~]$ sudo grubby --set-default=/boot/vmlinuz-4.18.0-240.1.1.el8_3.x86_64
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________

### change the default index of the kernel in the boot menu:

```bash
[bob@centos-host ~]$ sudo grubby --set-default-index=1
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________


```bash
[bob@centos-host ~]$ man grubby
```

________________________________________________________________________________________________


Possible boot parameters that you can pass into the linux kernel:

```bash
[bob@centos-host ~]$ man bootparam
```

```bash
[bob@centos-host ~]$ man dracut.cmdline
```


________________________________________________________________________________________________



### On ServerA, ensure that boot messages are displayed, not silenced, for troubleshooting purposes.




- 1: Modify GRUB Configuration File `/etc/default/grub`



- 2: Locate the "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX" line and remove `rhgb quiet`.



- 3: Generate a new GRUB configuration file based on the current system configuration:

```bash
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```


- 4: Restart the system for the changes to take effect:

```bash
reboot
```



________________________________________________________________________________________________



### Create a backup of the Master Boot Record (MBR) located on the device "/dev/sda" of ServerA. Store the backup in the file "/backup/mbr.img":

- Block Size: 512 bytes

- Number of Blocks Copied: 1

- Verification: Confirm successful backup creation




```bash
mkdir -p /backup

dd if=/dev/sda of=/backup/mbr.img bs=512 count=1 status=progress
```
